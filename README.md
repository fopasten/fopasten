### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Felipe, my main interests are learning new things, solving problems, building things (tangible or intangible), road cycling, music, drumming and cats :)

I'm the proud father of 3 beautiful cats with my wife.

### Background

I majored Comp Sci at Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile for 4 years, even though I wasn't able to finish the degree I learnt a lot, mainly learning to learn and the foundations of Python development. As the need to be independent emerged, I had to dropout and started working in retail for two years at Helly Hansen which gave me a great sense of knowing what the customer needs and which product might fit best. Worked two jobs (50hrs a week) for almost a year, the second one was a Cowork as front desk. 

Just when all hopes of having a job related to engeneering or comp sci were fading away, I got the oportunity to work at UNAB as a tutor for online programms, a couple of tech related oportunities allowed to show my skills and I was transfered to the learning technology team, where I worked for almost a year and a half, Imanaged the tech agenda of the onlinecourses dept, translated the need of the users to the IT dept, as I started working closely with the IT dept, they took interest in me and offered me a position as developer. Later on as they trusted me with more projects I got promoted to Project Manager.

In a short time I've been lucky to have different positions with different perspectives, which gives me a broader point of view when approaching or coming up with solutions.

### Current position

Currently @ Universidad Nacional AndrÃ©s Bello as IT Project Manager mainly focused on all LMS related Projects, also doing a bit of software architecture and leading our small development team.

Our most recent achievements (mainly related with migrating to Canvas LMS) are 
- Refactoring all the Java Building Block apps made for Blackboard Learn LMS into Apps on the LTI standard.
- Migrating almost 60k users, and almost 1k courses with instructional design from Blackboard to Canvas LMS, including a process that generates classrooms templates based on our academic system "Banner" that results in nearly 15k courses per term.
- Deploying apps using AWS IaaS and PaaS, including some full serverless microservices.
